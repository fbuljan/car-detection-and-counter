# Car Detection and Counting

A team project developed as part of the _Digital Image Processing and Analysis_ course at FER (Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb).

## 📌 Project Overview

This project compares the performance of:

- Pre-trained YOLOv8 model
- Pre-trained Fast R-CNN model
- Fine-tuned pre-trained Fast R-CNN model

on the task of car detection and counting in road images.

## 📁 Dataset

We used a publicly available dataset: [Car Object Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection) from Kaggle.
